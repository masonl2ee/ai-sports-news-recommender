> ðŸš§ This project is currently in its early development stage!  
> Features are actively being developed in the `test` and `feature/*` branches.  
> The `main` branch contains only the initial project structure for now.

An AI-powered sports news recommendation platform that delivers personalized news articles based on users' interests in teams, players, and more.

This project is built with a full-stack architecture:
- **Frontend**: Developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Backend**: Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Recommender System**: AI-based engine using Python and PyTorch
- **Databases**: MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL for storing user data, news, and logs
